# DSA210-TermProject

I am Berkay Kesgin, a student from SabancÄ± University, and this is my DSA210 Term Project. The aim of this project is to analyze the impact of coffee and water consumption on focus and sleep duration using my own collected data, exploring potential correlations and predicting outcomes with data science techniques.
