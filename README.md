# DSA210-TermProject

I am Berkay Kesgin, a student from Sabancı University, and this is my DSA210 (Introduction to Data Science) Term Project.
In this project, I will analyze the relationship between coffee and water consumption and their effects on focus duration and sleep patterns, supported by my collected data.

# Project Overview

Coffee is often associated with improved focus and productivity, while excessive intake may disrupt sleep. Likewise, proper hydration plays a crucial role in cognitive performance and well-being. But how do these factors interact?

This project aims to uncover the real impact of coffee and water consumption on focus and sleep quality using data-driven analysis. Over the next months, I will systematically track my daily intake, analyze focus patterns, and identify trends in sleep efficiency to better understand these relationships.

# Objectives

**Understanding the Impact of Beverage Consumption on Focus & Sleep**
	•	Analyze how coffee and water intake influence focus duration and sleep quality.
	•	Assess whether coffee timing affects sleep efficiency.
	•	Determine if higher water intake enhances cognitive performance and sleep duration.

**Applying Data Science Techniques**
	•	Conduct statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
	•	Use data visualization to identify trends and correlations.
	•	Apply DSA210 concepts to a real-world dataset based on personal habits.

## Motivation

**Personal Curiosity**

I have always wondered if my focus levels and sleep patterns are truly affected by coffee and water intake or if it is just a perception.
This project will help me identify whether my habits influence my cognitive performance and sleep quality. By systematically collecting and analyzing data, I can determine if there are noticeable trends or if external factors play a bigger role than I assumed.

**Data-Driven Decision Making**

Rather than relying on assumptions, I want to use quantifiable data to answer these questions. Tracking my daily coffee and water intake, focus duration, and sleep efficiency will provide objective insights into my habits. This process will also encourage me to be more mindful of my consumption patterns and their effects.

**Applying Data Science in Real Life**

This project allows me to apply the skills I’ve learned in DSA210 to a real-world dataset that directly impacts my daily life. By using statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualization techniques, I will uncover meaningful correlations and refine my ability to analyze complex behavioral data.

Ultimately, my goal is to identify actionable insights that help me optimize my routines for better focus, productivity, and sleep quality.
