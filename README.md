# DSA210-TermProject

I am Berkay Kesgin, a student from SabancÄ± University, and this is my DSA210 Term Project. This project aims to analyze **the impact of coffee and water consumption on focus and sleep duration** using my own collected data, exploring potential correlations and predicting outcomes with data science techniques.
